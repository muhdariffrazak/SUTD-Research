This read-me file explains the code/usage of Panthera Lights.

This project uses arduino libaries at the AT-MEGA 2560 (arduino mega)
    The libaries are:
        -FreeRTOS
        -FastLEDs
        -Custom libary called PantheraSignalLights

The default pins for signallights are as follows:
    Right Signal Light -> pin 2
    Left Signal Light -> pin 8
These can't be changed as they are determined by the fast led libary.
