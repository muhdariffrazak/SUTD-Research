Developing a protocol for arduino:

2 Phases, connection and communication
- Connection ensures the arduino and computer are connected 
- Communication is sending and receiving msgs


Messages are composed of two parts:
- Order message
	-Tells type of action to do
- Parameters
	-Relevant informationn for the c

To avoid filling up the buffer, one simple solution 
is to acknowledge the reception of each messages, and 
avoid sending new messages if the previous one were not 
received. 

That way, we won’t have a buffer overflow and no message will be lost!



The Communication Protocol in a Nutshell

	1. Connection, you make sure the Arduino is connected

	Then, for each message you want to exchange, you send:

	2. The type of order (e.g. “MOTOR”)

	3. The parameters (e.g. speed)
